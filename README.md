## Project overview

This repository implements customer segmentation using K-Means clustering to group customers by purchasing behavior and demographic characteristics. The objective is to discover homogeneous customer segments that inform targeted marketing, product personalization, and resource allocation.

## Key results

* End-to-end pipeline for data cleaning, feature engineering, scaling, clustering, and visualization.
* Recommendations on choosing `k` using the elbow method and silhouette analysis.
* Deliverables: cluster assignments, per-cluster statistics, segmentation visualizations, and concise business recommendations.
